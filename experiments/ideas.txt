PopcornQuizz
    - quizz about movies, multiple modes (timed/tries and poster/frame)
    - an image of the movie (the poster or a still frame) is displayed very heavilypixelated
    - users must guess the title of the movie
    - timed mode: users get 30s, every second the movie gets less pixelated (pixels become smaller), infinite tries
    - tries mode: users get 5 tries, every try the movie gets less pixelated (pixels become smaller), infinite time
    - use an opensource API to get list of 100+ top most famous movies titles and posters (and stillframes if possible)
